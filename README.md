# ChanKit App

**ChanKit** is a simple and intuitive mobile application that helps users calculate monthly installment payments for products. Designed primarily for vertical mobile use, the app makes it easy for users to estimate their payment plans in just a few taps.

## 📱 Key Features

- Calculate monthly installments based on product price and payment duration
- Input custom interest rate per month (e.g., 0.99%)
- Automatically summarize:
  - Monthly payment
  - Total repayment
  - Total interest paid
- User-friendly UI optimized for vertical mobile view
- Supports automatic rounding for cleaner numbers

## 🧮 How It Works

ChanKit uses the **flat interest rate method**:

Monthly Payment = (Product Price + Total Interest) / Number of Months

Where: Total Interest = Product Price × Monthly Interest Rate × Number of Months
